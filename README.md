# Web support for FakeSMTP running in docker

The original project [FakeSMTP](https://github.com/Nilhcem/FakeSMTP) uses a java swing GUI which is fine if you
want something basic and don't wish to use docker.

This project provides web support for [FakeSMTP](https://github.com/Nilhcem/FakeSMTP)  running in docker with the following features
- rest api supporting common crud operations
- server sent events for 'real time' email detection
- web ui written in elm

The rest api produces email data modelled from a [MimeMessage](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/mail/internet/MimeMessage.html)
including attachments and other nice to know things you would typically like to see during development. 
See [API](#API).

# Setup

### Recommended  - Use docker compose

1. Within this repository, copy and paste the `docker-compose.yml` file into an empty directory on your local machine.
2. cd into the directory containing this `docker-compose.yml` file
2. `docker-compose up -d`. 

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:60500` which will display the ui (it may take a minute to start up).

To start with, its likely no emails will show up in the UI. The `docker-compose.yml` contains a `volumes` section. By default, any emails added to
`~/fake-smtp-emails` on your local machine will be visible on the UI. Feel free to change this to whatever you like!

```
    volumes:
      - ~/fake-smtp-emails:/var/mail
```


- See [API](#API) for rest endpoints. 
 
- See [API URL and port settings ](#API-URL-and-port-settings ) to change the IP and port.


### Without docker compose

If you don't wish to use docker compose, you'll need to start each container individually. 

1 - [FakeSMTP docker](https://github.com/munkyboy/docker-fakesmtp) needs to be run first

`docker run --name fake-smtp -d -p 25:25 -v ~/fake-smtp-emails:/var/mail munkyboy/fakesmtp`
 
2 - Start the fakesmtp-web container (Note: the host port must be `60500`, see [Configuration](#Configuration))

`docker run --name fake-smtp-web -d -p 60500:8080 -v ~/fake-smtp-emails:/var/mail mjstewart/fakesmtp-web:1.3`

If you need to change any configuration settings outlined in [Configuration](#Configuration), the docker syntax
for passing in environment variables is

```
docker run --name fake-smtp-web -d -p 60500:8080 \
-v ~/fake-smtp-emails:/var/mail \ 
-e EMAIL_INPUT_DIR_POLL_RATE_SECONDS=10 \
mjstewart/fakesmtp-web:1.3
```

# Configuration

`docker-compose.yml` is used as the walk through example.

### Volumes
The `volumes` mapping for both containers is

`~/fake-smtp-emails:/var/mail`

You can read this as - Within the docker container, `/var/mail` is used to store emails which is mounted to the host
directory `~/fake-smtp-emails`. **IMPORTANT** - Please ensure the host directory `~/fake-smtp-emails` has the correct
permissions such as non root owner and its writable. Both can be changed using `chown` and `chmod` respectively.
 
This results in 
- [docker-fakesmtp](https://github.com/munkyboy/docker-fakesmtp) writing emails into `~/fake-smtp-emails` 
- [fakesmtp-web](https://github.com/mjstewart/fakesmtp-web) reading emails from `~/fake-smtp-emails`
 
If you want a different host directory, be sure to change both volumes for each service eg:
`/some-other-dir:/var/mail`


### Poll rate

`~/fake-smtp-emails` is polled every 10 seconds to check for new emails. 
This can be changed by setting `EMAIL_INPUT_DIR_POLL_RATE_SECONDS`.

I would recommend this over 1 second to avoid potential issues in emails not getting parsed correctly.

### API URL and port settings

`http://localhost:60500` is used by default to prevent port clashes on the host machine. The docker port mappings must NOT
be changed as the ui is a SPA (Single page application). This means webpack injects the API endpoints when the bundle is built.

If you wish to deploy on a different IP and port, you'll have to manually build the project. 
See [Build custom docker image](#Build-custom-docker-image)

# Build custom docker image

By default, `http://localhost:60500` is the server IP and port the application is accessible on.
 
This behaviour can be changed by manually building a new docker image through the following steps.
  
You will need `yarn` and `maven` installed on your system. Once installed, go to the project directory and
execute the `build.sh` script.

Note: Since you're building a custom image yourself, feel free to remove my image name in any of the docker steps

Instead of this

```
docker build -t mjstewart/fakesmtp-web:1.3 .
```

you might like to change it to your name (this will also avoid any name collisions with an existing image off dockerhub)

```
docker build -t alice/fakesmtp-web:1.0 .
```

1. Optional - set server IP and port in `build.sh` using environment variable `FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API`. I don't really know 
of a usecase but I suppose if you were running this on a remote machine it could be useful? 

2. If `FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API` is updated, the `fake-smtp-web` service in `docker-compose.yml` must have its port mappings
updated to be the same. 

3. To avoid the docker image name clashing with the existing image on docker hub, change the image name
in `build.sh` to something unique.

    `docker build -t custom/fakesmtp-web .`
    
4. Run `./build.sh`

See [FAQ](#FAQ) for non docker build instructions.

**Note** I apologise for this ceremony of having to build a new image just for a port change, if there is a better way please 
let me know.


# API

## Server sent event stream  /api/stream/emails/{id} 

Subscribe to receive new emails. The id should be a unique identifier the server uses to track your session.
Eg - something like this is fine.

`http://localhost:60500/api/stream/emails/client123Blah`

The frequency of receiving new emails depends on the environment variable
`EMAIL_INPUT_DIR_POLL_RATE_SECONDS`. This is configurable in `docker-compose.yml`. 

##  GET /api/emails
Returns collection of all the emails.

Its possible to sort the emails by any field and order. For example, to get all emails 
ordered from newest to oldest.

`/api/emails?sort=sentDate,desc`

#### Example json email structure

- All string fields should be considered optional and may return null depending on the email parsing.
- Arrays are always empty if there's no data rather than null.

```$json

# FAQ

### Network error, the server could be down or you are not permitted to access this resource.

1. Confirm the volume directory on the host has the correct permissions. Such as read/write/execute and non root user.

2. If you're running this on a remote server or docker in a VM such as on a mac or windows, its likely the default image cannot be
used since the client javascript bundle has already been injected with the `localhost:60500` API endpoint. You will need to rebuild your own image using the docker ip
on your machine - See [Build custom docker image](#Build-custom-docker-image)

### Will this only work in docker?

Technically no, but using `docker-compose` really simplifies the setup.

To use without docker assuming you have some form of [FakeSMTP](https://github.com/Nilhcem/FakeSMTP) 
(standalone jar or in docker) writing emails to an output directory then...

1. clone this repo

2. set environment variables on your host machine. (Be careful - its common to need to reboot your 
computer for these variables to be updated or to `source ~/.bashrc` depending on your method.)

   - `EMAIL_INPUT_DIR=/output-directory` (The directory FakeSMTP is writing emails into)

   - `EMAIL_INPUT_DIR_POLL_RATE_SECONDS=10`

   - `FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API` (IP address and port the API will be deployed on, eg `http://localhost:60500`).

3. build

    You will need yarn and maven installed on your system. Once installed, go to the project directory and
    execute the following commands in order.
    
    ```
    cd src/main/ui
    yarn
    yarn run build
    cd ../../../
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

4. Run 

    Run the jar maven created in the target folder of the project root directory. 
    Specify the port you chose in FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API, eg 60500 using `-Dserver.port` option unless you use the default 8080.
    
    `java -Dserver.port=60500 -jar target/fakesmtp-web-1.2.jar`

# Set context path

1.
    When you want to set context path, you can do it for spring boot using `server.servlet.context-path` property.
    In addition, you need to update the `FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API` variable.
    
    For example if you add context path as 
    ```
     server.servlet.context-path=/mail
    ```
   
    append the context to `FAKE_SMTP_WEB_API` as below
    
    ```
    http://localhost:8080 -> http://localhost:8080/mail 
    ```

    Same applies to the port number as well.
    Note : For the standalone (no docker) implementation, we can keep same port number.

2.
    Change `publicPath` in file below to update the context path. 
    `src\main\ui\webpack.config.js`
    
    Example: if context path is `/mail` make change as 
    
    ```
      const publicPath = (env === 'prod') ? '/ui/' : '/';
      const publicPath = (env === 'prod') ? '/mail/ui/' : '/';
    ```

3.
    Recompile the application.

# Implementation details
- Spring Boot
- Spring Integration
- Elm

Spring integration is used to poll the `EMAIL_INPUT_DIR` representing the directory FakeSMTP outputs emails into. This
directory corresponds to the mounted host directory used in docker `~/fake-smtp-emails`.
The poll rate is configurable using `EMAIL_INPUT_DIR_POLL_RATE_SECONDS`.

Spring integration reads every new email in this directory and parses it into valid domain objects before sending
it into a pub/sub channel where 2 subscribers are waiting.

- subscriber 1 saves the email into a h2 in memory database which enables the rest api.

- subscriber 2 emits the email through a server sent event stream for real time email updates.

### UI
Since the UI is a SPA, it doesn't work so nicely with docker host:container port mappings since the javascript
bundle has the API endpoints injected during the webpack build.

webpack builds the elm bundle and assets into `resources/static` which is where spring boot serves static content by default.
webpack also generates the ui entry point `index.html` in `resources/templates` which spring boot serves up by default.


`cd /src/main/ui`

`yarn run build`

Development can be done using webpack dev server `yarn run start`.
